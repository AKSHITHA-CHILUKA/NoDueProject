# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the GitHub Docs Contributing Guide! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. Your contributions will help us improve the documentation on docs.github.com and make it even better for users like you. Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

To ensure a positive and respectful community, please read and abide by our Code of Conduct.

This guide provides an overview of the contribution workflow, including opening an issue, creating a pull request, reviewing, and merging the PR. Use the table of contents on the top left corner of this document to navigate to specific sections quickly.

## New Contributor Guide

If you're new to the project, we recommend starting with the following resources:

- Familiarize yourself with open source contributions and how to contribute on GitHub.
- Set up Git on your local machine to work with the project.
- Understand GitHub flow and how to collaborate using pull requests.

## Getting Started

To work confidently with our codebase, please review the introduction to working in the docs repository. If you're new to writing markdown files, you can refer to the GitHub Markdown reference for guidance.

Before making any changes, please check the types of contributions we accept. You'll be surprised to find that some contributions don't require writing a single line of code!

## Issues

### Create a New Issue

If you come across any problems or issues with the documentation, first search our existing issues to check if a related one already exists. If not, you can open a new issue using the relevant issue form.

### Solve an Issue

Browse through our existing issues and filter them using labels to find one that interests you. As a general practice, we don't assign issues to specific individuals. If you find an issue you'd like to work on, feel free to open a pull request with your proposed fix.

## Making Changes

### Make Changes in the UI

To make small changes like fixing a typo, correcting a sentence, or updating a broken link, navigate to any docs page and click on "Make a contribution" at the bottom. This will take you to the .md file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for review.

### Make Changes in a Codespace

If you prefer working in a codespace for GitHub documentation, refer to the "Working in a codespace" guide for more information.

### Make Changes Locally

To make changes locally, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. If you're using GitHub Desktop, set it up and use it to fork the repository. If you prefer the command line, fork the repo to make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
3. Install or update Node.js to the version specified in .node-version. Check the development guide for more details.
4. Create a new branch for your changes and start working on them.
5. Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them. It's helpful to self-review your changes to speed up the review process.
6. Push your changes to your forked repository.

## Pull Request

When you've completed your changes, create a pull request (PR) using the following steps:

1. Fill out the "Ready for review" template in the PR so that we can review your changes effectively. If you're solving an issue, don't forget to link the PR to the relevant issue.
2. Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so that the branch can be updated for a merge.
3. Submit your PR, and a member of the Docs team will review your proposal. They may ask questions or request additional information.
4. As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
5. If you encounter any merge issues, refer to a git

 tutorial to help resolve conflicts and other problems.
6. Once your PR is merged, congratulations! Your contributions will be publicly visible on the GitHub docs.
