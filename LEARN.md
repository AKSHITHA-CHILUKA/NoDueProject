# Project Overview

Welcome to the Learn.md guide for the project! In this guide, we will provide an overview of how the project is built and the key functionalities it offers. Let's dive in!

## Project Description

The project is an automated system for requesting and approving no-due certificates for students at the end of each semester. It is designed for colleges and universities to streamline the process of issuing no-due certificates to students. The system consists of the following components:

1. Admin Dashboard: Each department has an admin who is responsible for managing student, faculty, and course information for a particular year and semester. The admin credentials are generated by the developers and provided to the respective department admin.

2. Student Dashboard: Students can log in to the system using their credentials. Once logged in, they can access their dashboard, which displays a list of their subjects and the handling faculty for each subject. Students can request no-due certificates by clicking on the "Request No Due" button. This action creates a new entry in the requests collection.

3. Faculty Dashboard: Faculty members can log in to the system using their credentials. In their dashboard, they can view the requests made by students under their name. Faculty members have the authority to approve or decline the requests based on the student's eligibility.

4. No Due Certificate Generation: Once all the requests of a student are approved by the respective faculty members, the student becomes eligible to download the PDF of the no-due certificate.

## Technology Stack

The project is built using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) stack. Here is an overview of the technologies used:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and manage the application's data.

- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to handle server-side routing and API development.

- Angular 15: A JavaScript-based framework used to build the frontend user interface and handle client-side interactions.

- Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side.
